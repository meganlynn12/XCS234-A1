\section{Nonstationary Discount Factor $\gamma$}

In this problem you will consider a variable discount factor $\gamma$. In lectures, we proved that the Bellman backup is a contraction for $\gamma < 1$ in the infinity norm. 

In this problem we consider having a non-stationary discount factor and assume you want to run $K$ iterations of value iteration. Let $V_K$ and $V'_K$ be any two arbitrary initial value functions (at timestep $K$).
The time-dependent Bellman backup operator $B_k$ for an arbitrary timestep $k$ is defined as
\begin{align}
    V_{k-1} \overset{def}{=} B_{k}V_{k} = \max_{a}[ R(s, a) + \gamma_{k}\sum_{s' \in S}p(s' \mid s,a)V_{k}(s')]
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
    \gamma_{k} = 1 - \frac{1}{k+1}
\end{align}
Notice that the value function index is decreasing: $K,K-1,\dots,2,1$
